## What is a canonical task?

1. [Canonical tasks, environments and models for social simulation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1009629602618)
	- [Social simulation](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/social-simulation): the application of computer-based methods and technologies to replicate human social behavior in various environments and scenarios. 
	- In mathematics, canonical matrices are effectively matrices of a standard form and transformations can be performed on other matrices to show that they can be converted into canonical matrices. All matrices which, by means of allowable operations, can be transformed into a canonical matrix have the properties of the canonical matrix.
	- Canonical environment: an abstract form with known properties that can be used to represent environments.
	- Canonical tasks: abstract forms that capture aspects of the tasks undertaken by agents in applications models. 
	- Canonical model: A model incorporating a canonical environment in which agents undertake canonical tasks. Representations and effects of socially situated cognitive behaviour implemented in models with particular domains of application can be mapped unambiguously into common abstract models. Consequently, when there are demonstrated relationships among canonical models, those relationships apply to the applications models that map into the canonical models.
	- Initial representation of the canonical environment: the digit string. Ordering the 1s and 0s by operating site and event type (intruder, fire, mains collapse, chlorine leak,etc.) yields a digit-string representation of the environment.
	- function of the organization is correctly to recognize somecharacteristic of the digit string
	- Effect of actions on state captured through an action-state-change matrix. Transitioning from one state to next without taking actions is captured through a state-state-change matrix.
	- When each action in the collaborative task is independent, the collaborative task reduces to the independent task. When no actions are taken in the independent task, it reduces to the recognition task.

1. [Toward Safe Human Robot Collaboration byusing Multiple Kinects based Real-time HumanTracking](http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~skgupta/Publication/JCISE2013_Morato_draft.pdf)
	- 4 kinects run on 4 local machines. For each kinect, a seperate Kalman filter is used for each of the 20 joint. Therefore the information from the 4x20 kalman filters is sent to a common server where particle filters are used to fuse the information of the 4 kinects for each joint.
