1. [Inducing probabilistic context-free grammars for the sequencing of movement primitives](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8460190)
	Assumptions:
	- We assume each segment of the observed sequences to be a sample from an underlying library of movement primitives.
	- Any produced sequence has toresult in a continuous trajectory inside the state space. By restricting the operators to only produce valid grammars.
