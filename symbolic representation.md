1. [Inducing probabilistic context-free grammars for the sequencing of movement primitives](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8460190)
	- Assumptions: 1) We assume each segment of the observed sequences to be a sample from an underlying library of movement primitives. 2) Any produced sequence has toresult in a continuous trajectory inside the state space. By restricting the operators to only produce valid grammars.
	- Definitions: 1) A probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) is a 4-tuple G = (A,V,R,S), where A is a set of terminals, V is a set of non terminals, S is a set of starting symbols and R is a set of production rules. 2) Learning formal grammars from sequences of terminalsis referred to as grammar induction.
	- PCFG for movement primitives: 1) Θ is set of primitives and D is set of labelled demonstrations. 2) define the set of terminals as the set of primitives A = Θ i.e. primitives are immutable, implying that the search space consists of grammars that only differ in S, V or R. 3) Each grammar is a node in the grammar space, while the directed edges between nodes are defined by operators. Operators manipulate the rule set R of a grammar G to create a new grammar G′. 4) Posterior optimization- G* = argmax p(G|D) = argmax p(D|G) p(G). 5) p(D|G) = ∏ p(d|G). 6) p(d|G)= (1/|parse (d,G)|) ∑_{τ∈parse(d,G)} ∏_{(A,r,ρ)∈τ} $\rho$
