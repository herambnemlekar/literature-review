1. [Inducing probabilistic context-free grammars for the sequencing of movement primitives](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8460190)
	- We assume each segment of the observedsequences to be a sample from an underlying library ofmovement primitives.
	- Any produced sequence has toresult in a continuous trajectory inside the state space.
