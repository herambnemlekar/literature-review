## Predicting human actions
1. Anticipating many futures: Online human motion prediction and synthesis for human-robot collaboration
	- Predicts a window if future human motion given a window of past frames by training a conditional variational autoencoder on skeletal data.

1. Probabilistically Safe Robot Planning with Confidence-Based Human Predictions
	- When human behaviour departs from learned model, update the human model confidence in real time

1. *A Bayesian Approach for Task Recognition and Future Human Activity Prediction*
	- Task represented as a sequence of manipulated objects and performed actions.
	- Objects and actions are separately classified starting from RGB-D raw data. 
	- The task is modelled with a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), which takes as input manipulated objects and performed actions. The DBN is responsible for estimating the current task, predicting the most probable future pairs of action-object and correcting possible misclassification.

1. Intention-Aware Motion Planning Using Learning Based Human Motion Prediction
	 - 3D joint positions are tracked using OpenNI
	 - Next action predicted based on probabilities (not the most accurate way to say it, needs to be updated).
