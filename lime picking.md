## Lime detection

    - Motivation: Agricultural tasks are handled manually despite the expensive and diminishing agricultural labour, physically demanding and time-consuming operations.
    - Challenge: Unstructured environment - different colours, shapes, sizes, textures, reflectance properties, uncertainty in environment, changing illumination and shadows, and occlusions.
    - Sensors & Cues: Single camera fixed on the robot or/and on the robot arm. Multiple cameras for stero vision to get depth. RGBD sesnors for depth. *Spectral imaging for recognition based on reflection, especially when fruit and foliage have same colour. However it is sensitive to illumination, and there is also the possibility that the fruit and foliage have similar spectral signature.* Hyperspectral imaging (RGB + spectral imaging) provides complete spectral signature of each pixel, however requires extensive acquisition and processing time. Other cues - Thermal imaging is highly susceptible to illumination. Texture, usually combined with colour sensing. Shape is immune to illumination and very useful for spherical fruits, but is computationally intensive to extract, may be affected by perspective and highly sensitive to occlusions.
    - Algorithms: 1) Adaptive global threholding not suitable for image segmentation in unstructured environments and ignores shape information. Watershed segmentation considers grey scale image as topographical surface. 2) Clustering is sensitive to illumination and ignores shape information. 3) Template matching only useful when variability of target object is small. 4-5) Global shape inference is computationally intensive. Local shape inference with circular Hough transform is used for spherical fruits like tomatoes. 6) Neural networks with RGB values as features. Waschs et al. (2010) use three NNs, one each for RGB, HSV and L\*a\*b\*, and then take a majority vote.
    - Future challenges: 1) Use other cues like texture with colour for segmentation. 2) Make hyperspectral imaging computationally manageable for real-time use. 3) Realize the entire shape and pose of occluded fruits by using some prior knowledge of the expected shape. 4) Apply Gestalt principles of good continuation inspired from human vision for occluded fruits. 5) Active vision like Blake (1992) by combining planning with 3D inference. 5) 3D estimation of fruit, peduncle, nearby leaves and branches. 6) Extensive evaluation of the performance of proposed methods along with creating a public dataset for future evaluations.

    - Branches are simplified to a series of cylinders. Therefore for collision detection, collision should be checked between: 6 cylinders of the robot x (no. of branches x no. of cylinders per branch).
    - Limitation: Branches easy to model as cylinders in the litchi plant simulation as the branches are not heavily covered with leaves.

    - Expands far less nodes than RRT or RRT connect and is significantly faster. From the experiments it seems that the cost is that is produces sub-optimal paths that are far worse than those produced by RRT.
